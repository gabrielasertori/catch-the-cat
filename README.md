## 🐱 How it works

The game was really fun to code and it was a checkpoint to understand the html DOM (Document Object Model) and how works with it.
The cat will be placed at some part of the page, but not rendered untill the player clicks where the cat is. To guide the clicks of the player, information will be displayed at the screen if it is away or near the cat.

## 🐟 Why beta?

So much changed since the first commit and I'm working to upgrade the game with new features, like:
- A counter to display how many clicks the player had to do untill reach the cat,
- A timer to display how fast the player could be,
- More levels of difficulty.
